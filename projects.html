                                <p><br>Knowing how long it takes to get from A to B is very important - distance, for many people, can be an abstract concept that is difficult to comprehend, while time is something that everyone has an instinctive ability to understand. See[k] aims to raise awareness of alternative forms of transportation through graphic based wayfinding signs throughout Blacksburg, VA. The See[k] Android app provides instant travel time comparisons to any location, and can launch real-time travel directions.</p>

                                <p>The See[k] Android app is a part of my larger involvement with Design For America. I am the head of the See[k] team, which includes undergraduates from Virginia Tech's colleges of Engineering, Urban Planning, Architecture and Design, and Science, as well as Virginia Tech faculty, and community partners from the Town of Blacksburg. In the 2015/16 academic year, we plan on manufacturing official See[k] road signs and installing them in Blacksburg, as well as releasing an iOS version of our existing app.</p>
                                <p>I built See[k] for Android with a focus on Android design principles and material design. The app uses a Parse database (for future iOS integration) and Google Maps and Location API's for travel time information.</p>

                                <p class="center-text">"Find hot single naps in your area"<br><br></p>
                                <p>NapMap is an Android app I built as a part of VT Hacks in February 2015. NapMap is a crowdsourced platform for finding the best place to take a quick nap on the Virginia Tech campus. Users can submit their favorite nap loctions, as well as rate, comment on, and reserve other nap locations. The highest rated nap spots get featured on the NapMap home page.</p>

                            <div class="col s12 l8">
                                <p>The goal of NapMap was to learn about handling large amounts of data using a Parse database, explore possibilities with Google Maps in an Android app, and learn the basics of Android material design. I designed, built, and published the app in the span of 36 hours as a part of VT Hacks, the Virginia Tech hackathon. Future ideas I have for NapMap include sharing photos of nap locations (or your friends napping). My biggest concern with NapMap is the unmoderated sharing of crowdsourced content, and I may use NapMap in the future to explore solutions to the various problems that arise from it.</p>

                                <p><br>Designed and built using over 225 feet of bungee cable, this chair is a unique sitting expeirience that can be used both as a rocking or a stationary chair.</p>

                                <p>The bungee chair originiated as an exercise in furniture design. The goal was to make a chair as simple as possible that went above and beyond the expectations of a standard chair. I worked with two other designers to design and produce this product. While designing the form of the chair, we envisioned it as more of an art installation than a piece of furniture, which led to the very fluid, rounded design. This shape also allows the chair to function in two ways: upright as a stationary chair, and on it's side as a rocking chair. When exploring materials for the final product we built multiple scale models out of plywood, cardboard, and acrylic. For the seat of the chair, we explored options including rope, polyester bands, and medical bungee cable. We decided on plywood and bungee cable for their appearance, availability, and production cost. Each side of the chair is made of two layers of plywood cut from a router and glued together. Thirteen wooden dowels provide structural support in key stress areas of the product. The final chair contains just over 225 feet of bungee cable woven in a diamond pattern to provide a visually appealing result and a very comfortable sitting surface. The final product can support users over 200 pounds and is comfortable for users ranging in height from below 5 feet tall to over 6 feet tall.</p>

Each subsequent layer is printed overtop of the previous, creating a compound design that is difficult to reproduce. A band of metallic material with microprinted text separates the transparent part of the bill from the printed section.</p>

                                <p>The bills are arranged in a vertical format, as opposed to the classic horizontal layout, to accomodate for the way one holds a dollar bill in their hand. This allows the content of the bill to be easily identifiable when held in your hand. Each value bill is assigned a distinct color, printed in its own layer, that will age gracefully, allowing denominations to be identified easily from a distance throughout the life of a bill. The fronts of the bills contain the original classic portraits from the historical currency, as well as metallic seals of the Treasury Department and United States Federal Reserve. The difficult to reproduce pattern in the background of the bill is a topographical map of a classic American landscape, from Yellowstone National Park and the Shenandoah Valley on the one and ten dollar bills, to the surface of Mars on the one hundred dollar bill.</p>
                                <p>The backs of the bills feature a classic American Landmark, as well as the bill's serial number and print run. The value of the bill is printed in English at the top right, as well as in numeral form in a horizontal orientation in the top left. Since the topographical map is printed as the base layer on the transparent bill, it is viewable in reverse on the back of the bill.</p>
